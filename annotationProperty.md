## Annotation properties used in ClinEpi studies

ID | Label | ontology label | Definition
-- | -- | -- | --
EUPATH:0001006 | replaces | replaces | Annotation property that records ontology term IRI that original used in   the study.
EUPATH:0001008 | unitLabel | unit label | Annotation property that specifies units that are associated with a variable (if any) in a human-readable format. Use abbreviations.
EUPATH:0001009 | unitIRI | unit IRI | Annotation property that specifies the IRI of unit from the unit ontology (UO).
EUPATH:0001010 | dataSet | dataSet | Annotation property that specifies dataset that a term belong to. 
EUPATH:0001011 | repeated | repeated | Annotation property that indicates terms that were assessed longitudinally / repeatedly over time.
EUPATH:0001012 | is_featured | is featured | Annotation property that specifies important terms to be highlighted.
EUPATH:0001013 | hidden | hidden | Annotation property that indicates that to hide terms in the UI and also in the download files.
EUPATH:0001014 | scale | scale | Annotation property that identifies terms that are on the log scale or natural log scale, as opposed to on the linear scale.
EUPATH:0001015 | is_temporal | is temporal | Annotation property that specifies terms that are related to time, to be   used in visualizations looking at data over time. Also to be used in   subsetting tab histograms (to indicate that the data range should not include   the origin)
EUPATH:0001016 | mergeKey | merge key | Annotation property that specifies key terms with longitudinal/repeated measures in the studies .
EUPATH:0001017 | defaultDisplayRangeMin | default display range min | Annotation property that specifies default minimum value for each term’s   range. Useful to ensure that histograms for related terms have the same x-axis range
EUPATH:0001018 | defaultDisplayRangeMax | default display range max | Annotation property that specifies the default maximum value for each   term’s range. Useful to ensure that histograms for related terms have the same x-axis range
EUPATH:0001019 | defaultBinWidth | default bin width | Annotation property that specifies the bin width for each term’s histogram.
EUPATH_0001020 | forceStringType | force string type | Annotation property used to annotate numeric terms as strings. Numeric terms annotated as strings will ALWAYS be ordinal. Study specific.
